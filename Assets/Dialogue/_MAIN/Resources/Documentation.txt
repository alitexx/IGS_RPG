-- dont use this exact text file as dialogue!! this is only for documentation!!!

put ',' between commands to separate them so they all run at the same time!

-- basic structure:
name "dialogue" command

-- NAME -- 
	for a character to enter the scene:
		enter character_name "i am in the scene!"
			notes:
				this always defaults to revealing the character
				must be done for the character to spawn in
				needs text in order to work atm

	for temporarily renaming a character under a different name:
		character_name as ??? "this is MYSTERIOUS!!!"
			notes:
				MUST INCLUDE " as " TO COUNT!! exactly as it's positioned there
				character must be introduced into the scene first (via enter character_name)

	for moving characters:
		character_name as yoMama at 1 "WHEE!!!!"
			notes:
				you don't need to have the " as ", but the " at " must come after the " as " if it is present
				still being tested on values that work bc honestly i forget

	for different expressions:
		character_name [sprite_name] "yippee!!"
			notes:
				must include the [sprite_name] immediately after the characters name with the sprites name
				sprite must be in the designated character's image folder (assets/_main/resources/characters/character_name/images)
				image does not need extensions (.png) but it must be the EXACT name. keep names clear and concise

-- DIALOGUE --
	
-- COMMANDS --
	for showing/hiding characters:
		Show(char1 char2 char3 -immediate true)
		Hide(char1 char2 -i false)
			notes:
				-i and -immediate are to determine if the characters should instantly appear or fade in
				i can put in something for speed but i have yet to do that yet, nor do i think we need it
				-i and -immediate default to false, and DO NOT WORK AS OF NOW!! i'll get it working later

	for character creation:
		CreateCharacter(Yo Mama -enabled false)
			notes:
				-enabled is for if the character should be shown on screen right now
				do this before doing ANYTHING with these characters!!!

	for moving a character:
		MoveCharacter(character_name 0 0.2 -spd 0.1)
			notes:
			-spd is how fast they should be moving (can also be -speed)
			second param (the 0 in this case) is how far in the X direction the character goes (side to side)
			third param (the 0.2 in this case) is how far in the Y direction the character goes (up and down)
			both of these can take negative values

	for highlighting/unhighlighting all characters:
		Unhighlight(char1 char2 -only false)
		Highlight(char1 -o true)
			notes:
				-o and -only are to determine if these should be the only character shown. so for the second command,
				char1 will be the only one highlighted and all other characters will be unhighlighted.

--CHARACTER SPECIFIC COMMANDS --

		character_name.Move(0 1 -spd 0.5)
