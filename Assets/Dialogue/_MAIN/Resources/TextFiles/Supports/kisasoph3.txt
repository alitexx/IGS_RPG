Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Kisa... please. Tell me."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Fine. If you must know, I encountered some... difficulties on the first floor. I managed to get out, but not without a sprained ankle."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "I noticed earlier when we fought. You were not as mobile as you usually are. Here, let me assist you."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "I am quite alright, Sophie. A sprained ankle is a mere inconvenience."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Do not lie. If it affects your ability to move, it requires treatment. Sit."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "... If you insist. You may examine it, but no more."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "..."
sophie "Although I would recommend resting and cooling your ankle, this is no time to rest. I will wrap it to ease the discomfort."
sophie "It would have been best to inform me of this sooner, Kisa. Even Alan or Nicol could have assisted you. Why did you not speak up?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Because we are fighting for our lives, and you expect me to whine about a little ankle twist? I am an adventurer, Sophie, not some helpless damsel. A sprain will not slow me down."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "A minor injury can become a major one if it affects your movement. I am no mind reader, Kisa. If you are hurt, you have to tell me. There's no shame in asking for help."
sophie "Even our argument could have been avoided if we spoke this morning. I am not asking you to open your heart to me, but... I cannot help you if I am not aware of a problem. Can we work on being more open?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "You act like it is so easy. Yes, I will be more open."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Kisa... I feel as if there is a rift between us. We used to be able to talk, fight side by side without this tension. What changed?"
