Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "I am sure that you could take <i>one night</i> off to celebrate your victory over a <i>lich</i>. If you have any issues, you can tell your superiors that a beautiful elven maiden has swept you off your feet and insisted on buying you a drink."
kisa "Or that you needed the evening to write a letter to your mother, who is worried sick about your well-being. Merely a suggestion."
