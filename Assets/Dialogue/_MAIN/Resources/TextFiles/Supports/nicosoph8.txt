nicol "Ah, Sophia! I see that you are ready to speak to me again. What do you need?"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Do not patronize me. Regardless..."
sophie "I have come to the realization that I have not seen a... person of your variety. Where do you hail from, if you do not mind the intrusion? An aristocat such as yourself must have a place to call home."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "This is no inconvenience to me, Sophia, especially since it is a common question. My origin is... uncommon. Do you know the wizards of Calister?"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Indeed, my brother dreamed of joining their order. You hail from their guild?"
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "One could say that. You see, one day I was living my life peacefully, resting on a window sill and basking in the rays of the sun. The next, I was startled by my master's fireball gone awry. I fell backward, and the next thing I knew, I was walking on two feet!"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "... You expect me to believe that you are some freak accident caused by a cat getting mixed into a wizard's spell and becoming humanoid?"
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "It is the truth. The wizards were happy to take me in, especially with my innate magical prowess. It would make sense, especially given my magical transformation! I am glad that I did not die or become a living pile of slime that day, however I do miss my tail."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Although your story does not sound feasible, I am not proficient in the world of wizardry and you have no reason to lie to me. It is surprising, to say the least."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Very surprising, indeed! The only downside is that now I stand out amidst a crowd, as there is only one of me in existence. I embrace it instead of shying away!"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Is that where the overly animated persona comes from? "
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Persona? Bah! No, it is who I am! I am Lord Nicol, a humble yet noble aristocat!"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "...Certainly."
