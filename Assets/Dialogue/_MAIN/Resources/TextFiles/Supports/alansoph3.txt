alan "It is rigorous but routine. Mornings are for physical conditioning, with afternoon practices varying based on the day. Combat practice was where I excelled, but mounted combat... not so much. Weapon drills were always fun, though."
alan "There is little time in between, spare a few meals, but they ensured we stay at our best. Most days end with sparring until we are too exhausted to lift our swords."

sophie "That is quite a disciplined and demanding regimen."

sophie "It is similar in intensity, but different in focus. As a monk, my training blends meditation, prayer, and physical conditioning. Spiritual energy holds more value than brute strength, so balance is key."
sophie "My students and I would regularly undergo intensive training retreats to focus on advanced techniques or meditation without interruption. I tend to be... easily aggravated when I have not meditated in some time."

alan "Understandable. Even when I am not on duty, I still train. It has become a hard habit to break. Perhaps we both require some time to relax."

sophie "Quite the ironic thought in the lair of a lich. But you are right. Perhaps we will find peace once this lich is dealt with."
