sophie "I realize now that I have been cold towards you when you have shown me nothing but kindness. I am simply... stressed. And when stressed, I have been told that I am impatient."
sophie "There are too many sources of my stress to count: the looming threat of a lich, my students' disappearance, Kisa... and yes, even you. You vex me, and although that is partially your own doing, I have been critical of you from the start."

sophie "No, you do not understand. I have been critical because... you remind me of someone. My brother."

sophie "Your personalities, your love for magic, it all... reminds me of him. Yet he was the one who coerced me into confronting the Gilded Fang when I was a mere child."

Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "It is alright, Nicol, it is merely my past. I was able to restore order to Zaro at a later date, but that memory still haunts me. My brother's corpse was never found, but we were able to have a funeral regardless."

nicol "We are <i>not</i> the same! I would never do something so deplorable. I apologize again for your loss, Sophia. Is there anything I can do for you? I know I have not caused your pain, but I can try to alleviate it. It is the least I can do."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Thank you, Nicol, but it is quite alright. I have cried my tears and moved forward. Your concern is appreciated, but I would much rather push forward that discuss my past."

nicol "The ever-patient Sophia has returned! I understand, but perhaps we could speak more once we locate your students? I would love to hear your story, if it is not an intrusive request."
