Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "They are nothing but a mockery-stripped of their identity, peace, even the dignity of death. Morsophus is an abomination... and he may have already harmed my students. Once he is destroyed, the dead will finally rest."

alan "Horrible. It is hard to fathom that one would be so cruel, simply because they wish to live forever."

sophie "It is far more than living forever: it is power, control... selfishness in the purest form. This is not right. We live until our time is up. We cannot decide how long we live, and we cannot decide when our demise shall be."

alan "(I fear how collecting souls could cloud my consciousness. I have not collected any souls today, and I will not harm my party, but... should I truly collect souls to revive Leora? I am starting to doubt myself.)"
