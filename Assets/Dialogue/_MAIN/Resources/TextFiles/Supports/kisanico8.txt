kisa "Although your situation is... different, I believe I understand the purpose of your story. My confession disoriented Sophie and she needs time to discern the nature of her feelings for me. I know my feelings, but she does not know hers."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
SetSprite(nicol flipped)
nicol "Exactly! Sophie requires your patience. In the meantime, we should progress, yes? I doubt she will come to her decision today. She is rather stressed, I am sure her mind will be less clouded with Morsophus defeated."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "I agree. I simply have to push it from my mind and focus on the task at hand. Thank you, Nicol."
