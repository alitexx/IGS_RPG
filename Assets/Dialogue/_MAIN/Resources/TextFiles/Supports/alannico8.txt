Highlight(nicol -o true)
SetSprite(nicol nicol)
nicol "Oh. That is oddly specific, especially since our current task does not pertain to such entities."
SetSprite(nicol flipped)
nicol "However I will keep to my word and give you the information you seek. Hopefully, you do not plan on making a deal with one of these beings, but if you must know..."
nicol "They often offer mortals an item they desire in exchange for a soul or specific task. They use tricky language and will twist the terms of agreements to their advantage. Signing their contract is equivalent to signing your soul away."

nicol "He claimed to possess a gift from the gods-the power to heal any wound. I joined him to vanquish kobolds attacking a village, but many were gravely injured in the battle."
nicol "I watched in awe and horror as he revived them instantly, a feat that would take even the greatest clerics hours. Curious, I approached him that night to learn more. That is when I saw it: a devil, speaking to him casually, as if this were routine."
nicol.Move(0.8 0 -spd 2)
nicol "Eavesdropping is not noble, but I learned enough-his ''gift'' was a curse. The devil granted him healing powers, but every wound he healed was inflicted on another. Saving one man meant sentencing another to death."
SetSprite(nicol flipped)
nicol "He was so desensitized to his actions... using his ''gift'' to become renowned around the realm. but I believe he broke the contract in the end and lost his soul for it. I would not know, as I quickly broke ties with him after that night."

Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "I did not know him well enough to feel morally responsible for his actions, but the thought of a man with that type of power... terrifying. More terrifying than any beast I have slain."

nicol "Regardless, A devil can only harm you if you sign their dotted line. They are powerful, but from my experience, they prefer the game to the outcome. Always cat and mouse with them, toying with their prey for twisted amusement."
