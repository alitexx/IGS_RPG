nicol "An interrogation, I see! Go ahead, my rival, and ask your burning question. I am certain that I will have the perfect response."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "It concerns the nature of pacts made with... unholy entities. Do you have any information on them?"
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Oh. That is oddly specific, especially since our current task does not pertain to such entities."
nicol "However I will keep to my word and give you the information you seek. Hopefully, you do not plan on making a deal with one of these beings, but if you must know..."
nicol "They often offer mortals an item they desire in exchange for a soul or specific task. They use tricky language and will twist the terms of agreements to their advantage. Signing their contract is equivalent to signing your soul away."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "(Nicol sounds as if he is reading from a textbook. He is oddly... somber? I suppose it comes with the territory.)"
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "There are ways to break a contract that do not involve fulfilling it, such as negotiating, bargaining, divine intervention, outsmarting or even defeating the unholy being. Was there anything more specific you wanted to know?"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Ah... I think you have told me all that I need to know. Thank you, Nicol."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Of course, my friend! Just promise me that whatever you do with this information, do not attempt to make one of these deals. They will offer you wealth, power, whatever it takes to catch your eye. One of my former allies fell under their curse, I do not wish to see you do the same."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Actually, would you mind telling me of the ally you speak of? The one who made one of these deals?"
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "He claimed to have a gift from the gods, the ability to heal any wound. I had joined forces with him to vanquish a group of kobolds storming their village, but during our epic battle, many men were gravely injured. I watched in awe and horror as he revived the men instantaneously, a task that would have taken the greatest of clerics hours."
nicol "I just <i>had</i> to know more, so once we retired for the night, I went to inquire about his mystical ability. There, I saw it: a devil in the flesh, speaking to my comrade so casually as if this was a normal occurrence. Eavesdropping is not noble, but I learned all that I needed to."
nicol "This man's healing ability was a curse. He had gained the ability from the devil, but each time he ''healed'' a person, that illness or wound was sent to another. He may have saved one man from death, but he sentenced another to theirs. Needless to say, I quickly cut ties with the party."
nicol "He was so desensitized to his actions... using his ''gift'' to become renowned around the realm. I do not know the whole story, but I believe his soul was claimed for breaking the contract. I do not know what it took, but he must have attempted to break the contract."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "That is... horrific. To think that one could grow so out of touch with their reality..."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "I did not know him well enough to feel morally responsible for his actions, but the thought of a man with that type of power... terrifying. More terrifying than any beast I have slain."
nicol "Regardless, the only way a devil can harm you is if you sign their dotted line. ... I suppose they could also kill you, but they enjoy the game more than the outcome. Always a game of cat and mouse with them, toying with their prey for their twisted sense of amusement."
nicol "...Alan?"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Oh- Yes, Nicol?"
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "It is nothing, you merely seemed... lost in thought. We should press on, yes? We cannot rest until Morsophus breathes his last!"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Yes, yes... Apologies. Let us continue."
