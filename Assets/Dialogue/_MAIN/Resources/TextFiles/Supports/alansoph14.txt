sophie "It is not that I did not want to lead, it was that I would feel burdened if anyone were to be harmed under my leadership. I work better alone, and my reclusive tendencies may have harmed the party."

sophie "On top of this, your superiors assigned you this task, and we all joined for our own reasons. It made the most sense for you to lead. "

sophie "Thank you for sharing this with me, Alan. We will speak more after Morsophus falls, but I am honored you trust me enough to speak of your past."
