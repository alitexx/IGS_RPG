kisa "I know that, <i>Alan</i>. But I have already told you. I wield weapons with finesse, I cannot use something as common and unsightly as a pitchfork. What, will I pitch them to death? Will I collect enough hay to throw into my enemies' eyes?"

alan "I am only offering ideas, Kisa. I see now that you are vehemently against pitchforks. Perhaps there is something else you may use..."

alan "In fact, would you prefer my sword? You must promise not to lose it as carelessly as you did your former weapon, but if it gets something in your hands other than that lute, I do not mind. Unlike you, I am not grossly against pitchforks."

kisa "... It appears your sword is faulty. The metal is too thick, so the whole blade is weighed down much more than it should be. See? I will have to accommodate for this extra weight by using both hands. Behold."
