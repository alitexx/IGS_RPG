Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Yes. You are not here to protect Isen, you are here on a devil's command. Is that correct? You may tell me, I will not tattle."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "No, I assure you, I wish to protect Isen. I was sent by the knights, not some devil."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "You lie, Alan. Both to yourself and to me. A knight does not kill his allies. And to think that I called you my rival..."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "That was... an accident. I did not mean to harm her. It is my duty to protect others as well as myself, I did what was right in the moment."

nicol "The devil may not have sunk its claws in yet, but it is sharpening them. You are one bad decision away from becoming a pawn. Let us complete our quest and be done here, yes? I can aid you no more, you have made your decision. You side with devils, not mortals."
