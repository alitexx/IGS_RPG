sophie "I <i>can</i>. Kisa's death was wrong."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Kisa's death was... unfortunate. Alan appears genuine in his remorse. We do not know the circumstances of their fight, and although I doubt Alan's judgment, I do not wish to provoke him as Kisa may have done. We have had too much conflict today."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Kisa would <i>never</i> have provoked Alan to the point that he needed to <i>kill her</i>. Kisa was kind, Kisa was friendly, Kisa was not a threat."
sophie "...The gods wish to torment me. I could not pinpoint my feelings towards Kisa last evening, but now I can. I realize now how much she meant to me in her death, and I am cursed to never tell her."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Although I do not know the extent of your relationship, I know that losing one that you treasured makes you realize how important they were. I am sure that Kisa knows the depth of your affection, even if you did not know it yourself until moments ago."

sophie "I hope you are right. I... I truly do."
