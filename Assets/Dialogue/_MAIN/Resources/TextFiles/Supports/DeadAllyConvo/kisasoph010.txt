kisa "Yes. It is strange, is it not?"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Kisa... I must ask to clarify, you say that Alan killed a specter version of Nicol? This is what you saw yourself?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "That is what happened. It could not have been the real Nicol, for Alan defeated the impostor. It was a very convincing specter, to give the ghoul credit."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Yes, but... Nicol and Alan did have a rivalry..."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Exactly, they <i>do</i> have a rivalry! Perhaps that was Nicol's latest attempt to fool Alan. You are reading into this too much."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Oh, Kisa... I do not know how best to help you. I wish I could take your pain away, but I cannot."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Your tone worries me. I am not in pain, what are you on about?"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "We will leave the second Morsophus is defeated, just you and I. Stay away from Alan if possible. I vow to keep you safe."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "What has you so solemn? Nicol... Nicol is fine, correct?"
