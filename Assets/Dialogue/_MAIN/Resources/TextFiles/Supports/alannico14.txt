nicol "I do have multiple rivals! They are scattered across the globe, almost like a secret guild. Many of them I have not seen for decades, but when I reunite with them, it is like meeting an old friend."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "That does sound like something you would be involved in. But what makes me special enough to be a part of your esteemed collection of rivals?"

nicol "Oh, you are <i>very</i> special! You see, Alan, our rivalry began in such a memorable fashion. Do you remember that tournament in Aelor's Vale? I had entered for the thrill of it, but my first opponent was a frost giant!"

alan "Yes. I <i>do</i> remember. I remember that I had to evacuate the stadium because a certain mage's fireball went awry. And somebody had to watch your cell, as you scorched half of the spectators. You could have used <i>anything</i> but a fireball."

SetSprite(nicol flipped)
nicol "And that is why I choose not to use fire magic! I am capable, but it... does not always end as I intended. Logically, a fireball was the only way I would win that fight. You saw that frost giant!"

nicol "That is exactly what you told me back then, too! And I still stand by my response, I do not back down from a duel! It is disrespectful to your opponent, they wish for a good fight as much as you."
