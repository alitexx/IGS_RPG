alan "The agreement said you would assist me each time I called upon you. I am merely making use of our pact. Is that so wrong?"
Highlight(miguel -o true)
miguel "It is not wrong, but I did not expect you to call on me at every opportunity. Still,  you are approaching the end of the first level, yes? Have you encountered any of your former allies?"

alan "No."
Highlight(miguel -o true)
