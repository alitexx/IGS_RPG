alan "I cannot kill again, I <i>will not</i> kill again. What I have done is wrong, and I will atone for my sins. You forced my hand, devil. You coerced me into killing my ally."

miguel "I did not force, I merely suggested. You were the one who wanted your mentor back, yes? Shift the blame on me if it helps you sleep at night, but you were presented with a choice, and your actions are yours alone."
