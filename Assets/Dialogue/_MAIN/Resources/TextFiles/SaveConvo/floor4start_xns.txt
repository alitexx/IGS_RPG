miguel "It is rather boring, now that there is no good time for you to collect more souls. You have a party of adventurers, why speak to me over them?"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "You rejuvenate them as well, yes? The party is tense, the least I can do is heal their physical wounds. I am sorry that my adventure bores you, devil, but I am here to defeat a lich and I will succeed with or without your recognition."
alan "Now, heal us and let us be on our way. Each time I gaze upon you, I remember the life I took. Please... let me have a moment of rest."
