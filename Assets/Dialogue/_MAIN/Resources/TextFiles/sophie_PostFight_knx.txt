nicol "Ah, at last. The final level of this wretched tower."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Sophie?!"
kisa "No, no no no... This is all wrong!"
kisa "I... I thought we were sparring..."
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Her aggression was unnecessary, thus this is a consequence of her actions."
nicol "Though we may find it difficult to accept, we must understand that this was one of the outcomes of this battle. Sophie could have easily done the same to us, could she not?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "But she wouldnâ€™t! Sophie would never hurt me!"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Kisa, it may be difficult to understand, but Sophie was not sparring. The dispute early into our venture of this tower, her sour mood just now... she was prepared to deal a fatal blow."
alan "I had to protect us, it was my duty as a knight. I apologize."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Why... why did I falter? I could have shielded her and spared her from this fate!"
Highlight(nicol -o true)
nicol "Now, Kisa, what is done is done. You could not have taken that attack and survived."
nicol "Alan, perhaps we could promptly conclude this adventure? Kisa will be alright, however, she requires time to mourn this loss."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Understood. We shall make haste."
