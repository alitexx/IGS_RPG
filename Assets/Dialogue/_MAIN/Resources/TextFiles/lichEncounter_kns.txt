alan "Lich! Prepare to meet your doom, justice will be served!"
lich "Oh? It appears more glory-seeking rats have crawled into my domain."
lich "Why must you mortals be so keen on disrupting my work? You come in droves but are so fragile. No matter, your souls shall sate my hunger tonight."
sophie "...So this is the fate that befell my students. They met their demise at your hands."
lich "If you speak of the last band of 'heroes' who wandered here, indeed. Feeble and disarrayed, they were snuffed out with a mere flick of my finger."
nicol "I have vanquished my fair share of liches, yet I had forgotten the oppressive aura they emit; their destruction for selfish gain sickens me."
lich "Are we not all driven by self-interest? You adventurers use the term justice when you deem your actions 'right', but you enforce justice for your own benefit. We are but two sides of the same coin."
kisa "We are nothing alike! You are harming others to further your own ends. Heroes have to make difficult decisions, but they do so to ensure the common folk can live without fear of villains like you."

lich "Through my studies, the cosmos have whispered to me, granting me magic new to this plane of existence. The more souls I collect, the stronger I become. Your group will make a fine addition to my collection."
alan "We stand ready for this moment. Let us strike, as a team!"
