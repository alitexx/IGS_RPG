kisa "Do you recall Sophie's insensitive demeanor at the entry of this tower? How she accused me, with my refined sensibilities, of harboring an attitude?"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Ah yes, your refined sensibilities. I vaguely recall such an event."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Do not use that tone of voice. Regardless..."
kisa "Sophie and I had an intimate discussion yesterday evening. I opened my heart to her, only to find her reception less than favorable. "
kisa "Naturally, I was quite crestfallen. Sophie interpreted my demeanor as one of annoyance and indifference, leading to her persistence earlier."
kisa "I inform you of this because Sophie, though formidable in strength, lacks awareness of emotions. I fear that this will lead to further conflict."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Thank you for telling me, that was oddly sensible of you to confide in me."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Excuse me, I am sensible all of the time!"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Of course you are. And where is your weapon?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "...I may have lost it on the journey. A lute works just as well, you will see!"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Sure. Regardless, we will reunite with Sophie together. She is a woman of honor, I am confident she is not truly upset over something so minor."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Yes... let us hope so."
