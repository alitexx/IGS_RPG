Highlight(kisa -o true)

Highlight(kisa -o true)

kisa "Oh. That."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Yes. Considering it is the source of this headache, I think it fair to know why we are split apart in this manner."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "...Perhaps, you are correct."
kisa "Well to be perfectly candid, I am surprised she knew at all something was amiss with my refined demeanor."
kisa "I hardly was obvious, she must be the most excellent reader of a person's true feelings to see beyond my facade."
Highlight(alan -o true)

kisa "The cause of my distress lies in last evening, when I initiated a... personal discussion with Sophie. I revealed the true feelings of my heart to her, only to find her reception less than favorable."
kisa "Naturally, I was quite crestfallen. However, it seems Sophie is even denser still, as she apparently sees no reason for my wounds to have continued into daybreak."

kisa "I believe she thought I took a petty dislike to her, which is why she was so persistent this morning. I do not tell you this to gossip, Alan, so do not think lowly of me if you were."
kisa "I think it is quite clear that Sophie is a formidable opponent and her lack of awareness when it comes to emotions could prove a further problem when we encounter her again."
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "I see. Thank you for telling me, that was oddly sensible of you, Kisa."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Excuse me, I am sensible all of the time!"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Of course you are. And where is your weapon?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "...I may have lost it on the journey. A lute works just as well, you will see!"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Sure. Thankfully for you, we will reunite with Sophie together. And perhaps things will work out more in your favor once we clear the air."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "What is it you are saying?"
Highlight(alan -o true)
alan "Considering what you said and what we have seen, it is not unlikely she did not fully understand your confession, or perhaps needed to sit with it for a time."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "I see. Perhaps... Perhaps you are right. I hope you are."
