sophie "Kisa..."
kisa "Sophie, you are worrying me. You never hesitate, yet you do so now. Where is Nicol?"
sophie "I hesitate because I do not know the best way to inform you of his whereabouts. It is a difficult topic to discuss with anyone, even someone I hold in high regard."

sophie "No. Well, perhaps one could think of it in that way."
